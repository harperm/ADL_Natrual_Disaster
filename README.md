# Applied Deep Learning: Detecting Natural Disasters

## Introduction
This project will use deep learning algorithms to automatically detect natural disasters in images. Tensorflow, Pandas and Numpy python packages were used on create the finalized model. 

The natural disaster dataset contains four classes:
Cyclone
Earthquake
Flood
Wildfire

This projects conducts experiments that will:
Help us fine-tune custom CNN from scratch based on the dataset.
Find optimal learning rates.
Train our model and obtain > 75% accuracy!
