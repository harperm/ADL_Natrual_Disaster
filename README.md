# Applied Deep Learning: Detecting Natural Disasters

## Introduction
This project will use deep learning algorithms to automatically detect natural disasters in images. Tensorflow, Pandas and Numpy python packages were used on create the finalized model. 

The natural disaster dataset contains four classes:  
- Cyclone  
- Earthquake  
- Flood  
- Wildfire  

This projects conducts experiments that will:  
- Help us fine-tune custom CNN from scratch based on the dataset 
- Use data augmentation to artificially create new training data, allowing the model to see new training data while training  
- Use callbacks to help fine tone the model  
- Train our model and obtain > 75% accuracy
